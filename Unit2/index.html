	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p><a href="https://squareup.com">shareup.com</a> and <a href="https://www.ableton.com">ableton.com</a><p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p><a href="https://squareup.com">squareup.com</a></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Size: Logo feels small. I like that things tend to be small to open up the space</li>
		<li>Balance: I like it centered top with steady two column approach</li>
		<li>Space: Nice that it has lots of open space and simple colors give it an open feel. It evokes a sense of ease and simplicity.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="https://www.ableton.com">ableton.com</a>
	<ul>
		<li>Size: I like the sizing of everything.</li>
		<li>Balance: I like that it is open in the above-the-fold space, but that it focuses on creating pods of educational video content along the three columns beneath the fold</li> 
		<li>Space: Very nice use of open space with unique colorful type front-and-center.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Similar</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Both have very simple messaging and simple, inviting font style.</li>
		<li>Both mix full-bleed imagery along with content pods throughout.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Different</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.ableton.com">Ableton.com</a> caters more towards people who already own the software and want education on how to use it.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
	<p>I am working to build a product website for a client of mine. The following sketches give a good idea of the overall site flow</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Home Page</li>
		<p>The above-the-fold portion of the home page aims to get users to enter their email address and to present the product overview.</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>About the product</li>
		<p>The "About the product page" is essentially a page to tell incoming press about all the key aspects of the product. It includes a product image along with key copy. Additionally there are multiple key features listed underneath.</p>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>About Us and Blog</li>
		<p>I didn't include wireframes for the About Us and Blog portions of the site since they will open up as separate pages. About Us goes to the corporate site. Blog goes to a WordPress blog site.</p>

		<p>Here is a jpeg that shows the wireframe that I built in OmniGraffle.</p>

		<img src="image/WEEK2Assignment.jpg">

		<p>The Omnigraffle sketches give a strong sense of focal point by limiting the amount of information in each section. I tried to build a hierarchy where we hit the main image and key information first and then slowly reveal deeper information below. As for balance, I wanted to have only two columns throughout so that there was clear balance between pages</p>
