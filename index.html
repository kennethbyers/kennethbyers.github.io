<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I run a marketing agency out of Nashville. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because my team often has to deliver websites for clients and I would like to have more of a grasp around what steps are required for building websites and apps. Being a newly established agency I would also like to establish my company website, blog and overall web presence. Lastly, I would like to enhance my understanding of online marketing overall and believe that a firm grasp on web development will help provide deeper insights.</p>
<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to continue as a brand consultant and agency leader working with a blend of both fortune 500 companies and start ups. Building on my previous experience as a marketing leader in the agency world at Ogilvy and the client world at Sony, I would like to focus more deeply on helping start ups with all of their marketing needs.
